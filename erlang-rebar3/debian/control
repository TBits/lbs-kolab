Description: Sophisticated build-tool for Erlang projects that follows OTP principles
 rebar is an Erlang build tool that makes it easy to compile and
 test Erlang applications, port drivers and releases.
 .
 rebar is a self-contained Erlang script, so it's easy to distribute or even
 embed directly in a project. Where possible, rebar uses standard Erlang/OTP
 conventions for project structures, thus minimizing the amount of build
 configuration work. rebar also provides dependency management, enabling
 application writers to easily re-use common libraries from a variety of
 locations (git, hg, etc).
