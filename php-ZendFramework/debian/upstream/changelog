Jul 13, 2016 - release-1.12.19

Security Updates

    ZF2016-02: The implementation of ORDER BY and GROUP BY in Zend_Db_Select contained potential SQL injection vulnerabilities, and have been patched.


Apr 13, 2016 - release-1.12.18

SECURITY UPDATES

    ZF2016-01: A number of classes, including Zend_Filter_Encrypt, Zend_Form_Element_Hash, Zend_Gdata_HttpClient, Zend_Ldap_Attribute, and Zend_OpenId, were using randomization methods with insufficient entropy. They have been updated to each use Zend_Crypt_Math, and the latter was updated to use PHP 7's random_bytes() and random_int() where feasible.


Nov 23, 2015 - release-1.12.17

    638: Fixes null byte tests in Zend_Db_Adapter_Pdo
    632: Updates the TLD list for Zend_Validate_Hostname to version 2015102801

SECURITY UPDATES

    ZF2015-09: Zend_Captcha_Word generates a "word" for a CAPTCHA challenge by selecting a sequence of random letters from a character set. Prior to this version, the selection was performed using PHP's internal array_rand() function. This function does not generate sufficient entropy due to its usage of rand() instead of more cryptographically secure methods such as openssl_pseudo_random_bytes(). This could potentially lead to information disclosure should an attacker be able to brute force the random number generation. This release updates Zend_Crypt_Math to provide cryptographically secure RNG, and updates Zend_Captcha_Word to use these new facilities.


Sep 15, 2015 - release-1.12.16

    504: Cannot parse huge documents in Zend_Dom_Query
    599: Wrong return type in DocBlock of Zend_Console_Getopt::getOption()

    610: Add ÃŸ (Latin small letter sharp s) to .de domain IDNA check
    612: Zend_Validate_Hostname does not validate NTP hostnames starting with '0' character

SECURITY UPDATES

    ZF2015-07: A number of components, including Zend_Cloud, Zend_Search_Lucene, and Zend_Service_WindowsAzure were creating directories with a liberal umask that could lead to local arbitrary code execution and/or local privilege escalation. This release contains a patch that ensures the directories are created using permissions of 0775 and files using 0664 (essentially umask 0002).

    ZF2015-08: ZF2014-06 uncovered an issue in the sqlsrv adapter provided by the framework whereby null bytes were not filtered correctly when generating SQL. A reporter discovered the same vulnerability is present in our PDO implementation when used with pdo_dblib, and could potentially be applied to other PDO adapters. This release contains a patch to properly escape null bytes used in SQL queries across all PDO adapters shipped with the framework.

    583: Fix typo in Zend_Validate_EmailAddress
    553: Drop Technorati API implementation as it is no longer available

SECURITY UPDATES

    ZF2015-06: ZendXml runs a heuristic detection for XML Entity Expansion and XML eXternal Entity vectors when under php-fpm, due to issues with threading in libxml preventing using that library's built-in mechanisms for disabling them. However, the heuristic was determined to be faulty when multibyte encodings are used for the XML. This release contains a patch to ensure that the heuristic will work with multibyte encodings.


May 20, 2015 - release-1.12.13

    567: Cast int and float to string when creating headers

SECURITY UPDATES

    ZF2015-04: Zend_Mail and Zend_Http were both susceptible to CRLF Injection Attack vectors (for HTTP, this is often referred to as HTTP Response Splitting). Both components were updated to perform header value validations to ensure no values contain characters not detailed in their corresponding specifications, and will raise exceptions on detection. Each also provides new facilities for both validating and filtering header values prior to injecting them into header classes. If you use either Zend_Mail or Zend_Http, we recommend upgrading immediately.

SECURITY UPDATES

    ZF2014-05: Due to an issue that existed in PHP's LDAP extension, it is possible to perform an unauthenticated simple bind against a LDAP server by using a null byte for the password, regardless of whether or not the user normally requires a password. We have provided a patch in order to protect users of unpatched PHP versions (PHP 5.5 <= 5.5.11, PHP 5.4 <= 5.4.27, all versions of PHP 5.3 and below). If you use Zend\Ldap and are on an affected version of PHP, we recommend upgrading immediately.
    ZF2014-06: A potential SQL injection vector existed when using a SQL Server adapter to manually quote values due to the fact that it was not escaping null bytes. Code was added to ensure null bytes are escaped, and thus mitigate the SQLi vector. We do not recommend manually quoting values, but if you do, and use the SQL Server adapter without PDO, we recommend upgrading immediately.


26 Aug 2014 - release-1.12.8

#418 can introduce potential BC breaks in the presence of complex SQL statements (for instance using SQL sub-functions). To fix this, use Zend_Db_Expr in group(), order(), or from() method calls.
