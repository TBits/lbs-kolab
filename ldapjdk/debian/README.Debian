Since ldapjdk has not released any updated tarball, the sources were downloaded via cvs:

cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs-mirror.mozilla.org:/cvsroot co -rLDAPJavaSDK_418  DirectorySDKSourceJava

The LDAPJavaSDK_418 are the sources for the 4.18 version which is the first tri-licensed version (GPL,LGPL,MPL)
