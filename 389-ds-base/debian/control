 Directory Server is designed to manage large directories of users and
 resources robustly and scalably.
 .
 This package provides detached debugging information for the 389
 Directory Server libraries. It is useful primarily to permit better 
 backtraces and crash dump analysis after problems with the libraries. 
 GDB will find this debug information automatically.
