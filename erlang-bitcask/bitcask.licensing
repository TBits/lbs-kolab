No problem.

There are some interesting claims in there about how "hard" it is to
install Riak, but I understand that phrasing it that way might be
useful to you.  For most users that don't want to use our pre-built
RPMs they only need Erlang and the Riak repository and the build
process will handle the rest.  Of course, having official distribution
packaging would be great -- as long as it doesn't cause operational
problems.

We have very good reasons why a Riak build creates a final package
which includes bitcask, webmachine, and so on.  If it is broken in
such as way as to rely on external installations of these things at
runtime (instead of compile time) then we would consider it to be an
unsupportable fork.

That's easy enough.  That is a simple oversight and will be fixed.

I give you permission to distribute it as-is.

This will be added.

The mailing list:
http://lists.basho.com/mailman/listinfo/riak-users_lists.basho.com

The bugzilla: https://issues.basho.com/

However, no need to raise these issues there now that you've talked
with me about them.  I can handle it.
