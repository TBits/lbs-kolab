This package is a fork of the cyrus package. The Debian Kolab Maintainers
maintain a separate source package for use with Kolab.
The Cyrus Maintainers know and accept this.
This package contains of some additional patches from the Kolab upstream
which are all licened under the same license as the cyrus upstream.

The specific Kolab patches are:
100-kolab-imapd.dpatch
105-cyradm.sh.dpatch
130-kolab-imapd-goodchars.dpatch
140-kolab-ldap.dpatch
150-kolab-auth_unix.dpatch
160-kolab-imapd.folderchar.dpatch
170-ldap-deprecated.dpatch

All patches are made by Kolab Upstream.

We also include the full copyright notice from the Debian Cyrus package as we
used the original packaging (thanks to the Debian Cyrus Maintainers for their
help).

Patches: 
The Debian version of Cyrus IMAP is heavily patched to adequate it to Debian,
and sometimes to add functionality.  All such patches are submitted upstream to
CMU, for proper inclusion in Cyrus -- but not all of them will be accepted, of
course.  See README.Debian for more details.  Also, many patches from the
current CVS release of Cyrus IMAPd are folded in Debian updates; these are
identified by "patchset" numbers, created by the cvsps utility.

The IPv6 patch by Hajimu UMEMOTO <ume@mahoroba.org> has been applied.

CMU release tarballs are often repacked minus the CVS/ directories to avoid
problems in my build system.
