    In addition, Code Synthesis Tools CC makes a special exception for
    the Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) which is described
    in the accompanying FLOSSE file.


    Free/Libre and Open Source Software ("FLOSS")
    °°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°
    1. Intent

    We want specified Free/Libre and Open Source Software ("FLOSS")
    to be able to use the specified GPL-licensed xsd runtime library
    and xsd generated code (collectively called the "Program") despite
    the fact that not all FLOSS licenses are compatible with version 2
    of the GNU General Public License (the "GPL").

    It is our intent to allow distribution of the entire Derivative
    Work (including the Program) under one or more of the FLOSS licenses
    listed in section 3 (section 2.a). It is also our intent to disallow
    simple relicensing of the Program for the sole purpose of using it in
    proprietary applications (section 2.b and 2.c). As an example, consider
    two hypothetical scenarios:

     a) You created a program that uses the xsd generated code and the xsd
        runtime library to access information in XML instance documents.
        Your program performs useful computations based on this information
        (sections 2.b and 2.c are satisfied). You distribute your program,
        including the xsd generated code and the xsd runtime library under
        the BSD license and make it available at no charge to all third
        parties (section 2.a is satisfied). Later you (or someone else) may
        choose to base their proprietary application on your code since the
        BSD license does not prohibit it.

        This scenario falls under this FLOSS Exception.


     b) You created a library that uses the xsd generated code and the xsd
        runtime library to access information in XML instance documents. You
        did not add to the library any other useful code that uses the xsd
        generated code or the xsd runtime library (neither section 2.b nor
        2.c is satisfied). You distribute your library, including the xsd
        generated code and the xsd runtime library under the BSD license and
        make it available at no charge to all third parties (section 2.a
        is satisfied). Later you base your proprietary application on this
        library since the BSD license does not prohibit it.

        This scenario does not fall under this FLOSS Exception (neither
        section 2.b nor 2.c is satisfied). You created the library for the
        sole purpose of making the xsd generated code and the xsd runtime
        library available to your proprietary application.


    2. Legal Terms and Conditions

    As a special exception to the terms and conditions of version 2 of
    the GPL you are free to distribute a verbatim copy of the Program
    as part of the Derivative Work that is formed from the Program or
    any part thereof and one or more works (each, a "FLOSS Work") as
    long as you also meet all of these conditions:

      a) You must cause the Derivative Work that in whole or in part
         contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof,
         to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
         under the terms of one or more of the licenses listed in
         section 3.

      b) The Derivative Work should contain one or more FLOSS Work that
         can be reasonably considered as derived from the Program or some
         part thereof.

      c) The Derivative Work should not contain any part of the Program
         that cannot be reasonably considered as a base of one or more
         FLOSS Work.


    3. FLOSS License List

      a) Any license listed in the "GPL-Compatible Free Software Licenses"
         and the "GPL-Incompatible Free Software Licenses" sections of the
         License List as published by the Free Software Foundation (FSF):

         http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html


    4. Definitions

    Terms used, but not defined, herein shall have the meaning
    provided in the GPL.

    Derivative Work means a derivative work under copyright law.


    5. Applicability

    You may choose to redistribute a copy of the Program exclusively under
    the terms of the GPL by removing the FLOSS Exception notice from that
    copy of the Program.
