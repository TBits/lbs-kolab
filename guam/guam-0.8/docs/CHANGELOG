v0.3

  * FIX: ensure connection process is cleaned up when the client closes the socket or errors out before the imap connection is not terminated
  * FIX: folder filtering now works across network packets (so if a list is split on the network; common w/large folder lists)
  * FEATURE: implicit SSL on listeners supported with { implicit_tls, true }
  * FEATURE: transparent STARTTLS to imap backends supported with { tls, starttls} in imap-servers config
  * FEATURE: a listener can be bound to a specific network interface with { host, <hostname or ip addr> }
  * FEATURE: listeners may specify which imap-servers entry to use with { imap_server, <NAME_OF_IMAP_SERVER_CONFIG> }
  * DOCUMENTATION: added basic deployment documentation


v0.2
  * IMPROVEMENT: Use the 'native' Erlang SSL config for tls_config; more flexible, less custom documentation/knowledge
  * FEATURE: STARTTLS supported between client and guam
