Security support
----------------

Since upstream support of sabre/dav will end during Jessieâ€™s lifetime,
security support will be provided on a best effort basis with upstream help.
Eventually, this package may be removed from once Jessie+1 is released if the
security support becomes too complicated or time-consuming, so sabre/dav users
will be advised to upgrade their servers to the new stable release.
